# OverSimplifeid RAG: 
## Introduction
This project is a exploration of RAG in llms. This repository explores the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique to enhance language model AI (LLM) capabilities by incorporating relevant documents or context during the generation process.

Overview
RAG offers a middle ground between fine-tuning, which requires extensive data and resources, and prompting, which demands creative effort. By augmenting LLMs with pertinent information, RAG enables more accurate and personalized responses without the need for fine-tuning.

Implementation
This repository provides a basic implementation of the RAG pipeline, focusing on the following steps:

* Prompting: Guiding the model with context or clues to prompt accurate responses.
* Retrieval: Retrieving relevant documents or data to augment the model's understanding.
* Generation: Utilizing the retrieved information to generate tailored responses.
Usage
To use the RAG implementation:

Install the necessary dependencies.
* Run the provided scripts for prompting, retrieval, and generation.
* Customize the implementation as needed for specific applications.
